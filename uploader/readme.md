I need someone to create a python script that uses the Youtube API to automatically upload videos to youtube. Once a file is 1 hour old, it'll upload the file. There are 4 different youtube accounts, and 4 separate directories - directory A needs to be uploaded to youtube account A and so on for the others. the script should run every hour via cron, and keep running once invoked by cron until there are no files older than 24 hours in the directories, and once this happens, script will end and will run again when cron invokes again. Should be straightforward, and shouldn't take too long. Let me know your price to do this! Thanks!
